			Integrity Spirituality Sensible Power and Authority<br><br>

			Why is power so important? It runs the world, it gives money value, it dictates the strong from the weak. A lot of people are scared of those who crave power because of how easily corruption seeps in. What happens when someone good obtains power? Is that too far from the truth? No it's not. <br><br>

			Integrity 5<br>
			Spirituality 4<br>
			Sensibility 4<br>
			Power and Authority 10<br>

			Someone asked me about why her boyfriend didn't sense the love when she kept buying her things. He wasn't spoiled as a kid, so that's not how he was shown love as a child.<br>

			I feel great about my values. However, I still feel quite young and my values seem to always be shifting in importance. I use to think intelligence was quite a useful value until all these reality TV stars started popping up.<br><br>
			I think sterotype threat needs to be first addressed by recognizing it. Second, why it should be tackled and how. There's no single value that will help you alleviate sterotyping, but a combination of things that one needs to be conscious of.<br><br>
