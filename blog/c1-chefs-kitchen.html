			<p>Right off the bat, one thing stuck out to me. The video quality wasn't very high. It didn't have paid actors nor did it seem to have any commercial purpose. I was sort of relieved. As Shareef told of the story how of DBC came to be, I could tell how surprised he was that DBC became the way it is now, and how it might even turn out. He talked about his two fears with students and teachers. For me though, my biggest fear was the actual teaching. Being a world class developer didn't mean you would be a world class teacher. Those are two completely separate skills. As you can tell, I was quite skeptical. I still am now, and I probably always will be. I don't mean it in any malicious way, but it should be healthy to question something new. However, I am extremely glad at the amount of effort Shareef and his team has put forth. It's also refreshing for him to emphasize that I, personally, have to take responsibility for my time at DBC.</p>

			<p>There were talks about his expectations of students. He seems to want students I describe as "Triple H" aka "Hungry, Humble Hippos." I would love to be a part of this type of environment. It's essentially a huge competition to learn as much as you can without the animosity. I've bounced around remedial jobs doing monotonous work praying I can do something remotely challenging. It's comedic how as a student in my younger years, easy-A courses tasted like sweets. Now, all I want is some sort of stimulation. Hate and love tend to walk a fine line together.</p>

			<p> feel as though my expectations of DBC has grown even more. Shareef wants angry students. Well, I want angry teachers and mentors. I hope we can work something out. One thing I want to point out is that DBC started off with teaching in mind and not a money making business. I believe if the foundation of any building is sound, then the rest will fall in line.</p>

			<p>All in all, I am pretty nervous about everything. Being in a room full of other students who want it just as bad as I do. But, my anticipation outweights my anxiety.</p>
