			At the start of my GPS pairing session, I got stuck; fairly quickly too I might add. I knew what they wanted, how they wanted it, but I just froze up. My guided pair gave me a small nudge and BAM, I went on going and didn't stop. How that feeling confused me slightly. Is coding such a bipolar activity as I think it is. Cause if so, I love it. I love the feeling of complete success and contemplating suicide in quick succession.

			I know it sounds rather silly, but I feel coding makes you competitive. Not against anyone particularly, but the idea of failure or something just unattainable. The world nowadays frowns upon savage and barbaric acts of masculine insecurity but I like to relish in it. Constantly proving to the world that I am a man by curiously writing code. Romans are jealous.
