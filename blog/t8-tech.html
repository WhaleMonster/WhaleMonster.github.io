				Regular Expressions are essentially a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern. Much like the way to determine the amount of permutations in statistics, it tries to narrow down the possibilities of what exactly you are looking for. For example, ruby using "d" to denote digits, so /d+/ would mean, any number, for any length. Doesn't matter if it is 1, or 32425436546754. <br><br>

				One thing to note about regular expressions is the versatility. You can combine string values and numbers to create a very thorough search parameter. To get specific with patterns, you can add groupings and quantifiers such as + or | meaning, something added with something, or the bar meaning "or".

				Delimiters are also a big part of RegEx. It denotes the range of which you want the search field. It is typically expressed with a /.

				When it all comes down to it, most programmers will have to know at least some regular expressions. Both ruby and javascript have Reg Ex built in while others need a library.
