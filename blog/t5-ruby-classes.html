			<p>
			Classes in ruby seem a little confusing at first to many people, but once you have it down, it's hard to forget.
			The first thing to note is what exactly is a class. It's essentially a group of methods that fall into one category. For an analogy, a person is a class. Their body parts of little methods defined within the class. Their name can be a method, or rather a attr_accessor.
			</p>
			<p>
			I bring this up because there are already some predetermined classes. For instance, String, FixNum, Integer, and so on and so forth. Changes to those can have dire affects on your code. If String were to be altered, every iteration of any string will have a changed value, so be CAREFUL.
			</p>
			<p>
			The last thing I want to say about Classes is that making a new instance of a class means you get all the methods you defined inside them to use. Especially if you are using the same methods across multiple files of code. All about efficiency.
