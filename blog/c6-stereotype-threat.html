			I have had previous dicussions on this in my high school and college classes. Although, the former was more just of an introduction. The idea is a form of self-fulling prophecy that a lot of people have about themselves relative to the task at hand. Certain ethnicities seem to excel in different activities. When it comes to coding, it is likely assumed that an intelligent programmer would be either caucasian or asian. This idea becomes engrained over time and any person not of either descent feel the odds against them. It would suck to try a hobby in which you were already predetermined to be at a handy cap. What gives?

			I think most people would agree that this thought process is a huge hindrance to both themselves and others. Sadly, a solution seems vague at best and likely over time. It should start with yourself. Being exposed to any environment creates change that might be unbeknownst to them. That's a start. One thing to note is that, I can only speak for myself and my experiences only pertain to myself. I am actually on the favorable side of this generalization. In fact, one reason I didn't want to major in Computer Science during undergrad was to break free of these stereotypes. And yet here I am, reinforcing them. Does me learning to code reinforce the idea that asians tend to be good at it? Is what I'm doing damaging the public perception of programming?
