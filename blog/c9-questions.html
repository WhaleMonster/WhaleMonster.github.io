			<p>
				In any field of any capacity, confusion is bound to arise. So then, how in turn do we solve our peculiar conundrum. Most would agree that the trick is simply asking the question as best as possible. Now, what does that exactly entail? I believe these are a few key points to recognize in regards to programming:<br><br>
				<ul>
					<li>Be succinct</li>
					<li>State the problem before any code is presented</li>
					<li>Make sure the title summarizes the problem</li>
					<li>Try to write in layman's terms as much as you can</li>
				</ul>
				To summarize what I meant, a question should always be understood. A message isn't a message without a receiver. It should be expressed with as much background information as possible, but only the neccesary parts. If the question is about numbers, talking about boolean values won't help your potential help help. (hehe)
				<br>Tell about what approach you took and why you took it. If someone could possibly answer it, you want them to narrow the amount of possible solutions down for a better chance at an accurate answer. Overall, put a lot of thought into where you want to be, and why there is a roadblock.
