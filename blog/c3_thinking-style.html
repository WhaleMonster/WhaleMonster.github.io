			Taking the personal thinking style test yielded me as a Concrete Random. According to the definition, we are essentially experimenters who prefer to test their own theories rather than taking advice from someone else. Trial-and-error is the name of the game. Self-direction seems to be a key component as Concrete Randoms want to see whether their own tactics are effective. Some words that have been used to describe CR's is curious, hands-on, impulsive, and impatient. </p>

			Overall, I would agree a lot with this definition. I've always been arrogant with my own train of thought. I feel as though someone else's perceptions and feedback can't account for my own experiences, thus I will always know what's better for me. When I run a piece of code, it's usually never right and it takes about 80-90 attempts before I get it correct. Hey, if it works it works.

			In terms of the growth vs. fixed mindset, it would seem that CRs would lean more towards a fixed mindset due to their inability to take in other's advice. However, I feel that isn't necessarily true. At least for me, I prefer to use my own intuitions and thoughts, but I don't feel limited in my growth. It would be impossible to not be affected by your environment, so everyone is influenced by something. To me, everything is a challenge. I tend to like things others make not prefer. I will take manual labor over office work even if it results in less money.
