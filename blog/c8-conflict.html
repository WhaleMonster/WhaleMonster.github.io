				Conflict will constantly surround all of us, there's no denying that. I'd like to talk about a certain incident that occured a few years ago at a concert.<br><br>

				I got into fights when I was younger, but I was 22 at the time. I did something that I thought I should've done, but I kind of regret it. How it started was a blur, but my good friend ended up getting into a fight a fight and I ran as fast as I could to break it up. That sounds all good and what not, but alcohol was involved with both parties, but I was sober. Why do I regret it? Well, did I really help anyone? Could someone have gotten seriously injured? Possibly, although I doubt it. But, since I did break up the fight, there doesn't seem to be a lesson to be learned. Usually when you do something wrong, there's a punishment for it. However, since no one got hurt, both parties weren't really punished. It's like a free card to fight as many people as possible since there's always going to someone that tries to break it up.

				I am fully aware that what I just said may have been a slippery slope fallacy, but the likeliness of it happening isn't astronomical. If I could go back, I honestly would not know what to do. There are too many factors to think about and I only acted on instinct. Maybe I will throw in a punch if it happens again. I'm not sure. All I know is that I learned nothing from that experience. I felt indifferent, yet I keep caring about it.
