			Today is all about arrays and hashes. So what is it exactly? Think of arrays and hashes as a form of information storage. It's a collection of various data types like strings, numbers, and boolean values, all stored in a given physical frame. An array looks something like<br><br>

			arr = [3, "London", false, "Soup"]
			<br><br>


			It's just a compilation of information. You can add values to it at the end or the beginning as well as deleting some values as well. Arrays are the preferred choice over hashes when dealing with non-specific information. If you are simply looking at one aspect of a property, like the list of ages of people in congress or how much profit was made each month.

			Hashes on the other hand are quite similiar with the most noticable difference being that hashes have a key + value component, meaning two items are linked. For instance, under the Barack Obama hash, the "First Name" key would have a value of "Barack". His "Location" would have a value of "White House". Hashes tend to look like:<br><br>

			hash = {<br>
			:firstname => "Matthew"<br>
			:lastname => "Mcconaughey"<br>
			:occupation => "Actor"<br>
			:oscar_winner => true<br>
			}<br><br>

			As you can tell, hashes store information in 2s. This is the preferred method when dealing with specific properties of a database. If you are looking up a person background history, hashes would be a great way to store it. Simply create a new hash and store an attribute as a key and the actual info as a value. That way, everything is organized and you don't need to scurry around looking for what you need.
