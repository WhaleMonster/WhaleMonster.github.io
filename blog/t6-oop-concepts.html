			Class Methods,
			what are they and how do you use them? Well for starters, lets try to break this down to seperate parts so you can see it later as a whole. First, it's a method, thus it has a specific algorithm that it carries out. Two, it can only be accessed from a object of its class. For instance, Fixnum is a class, and there are methods that can be done to any instance of Fixnum, which essentially anything that includes a number(outside of strings). Let's say that I made a class called Humans. I can create methods like breathe, walk, and run. However, those methods only pertain the objects of the human class. <br><br>

			If I were to do something like 3.walk. It would return an error. But, if I made a new object from class Human called Batman and did Batman.walk would return whatever the walk function incorporates. I hope that clears up any misunderstanding of how class methods operate.
