			Let's talk about ruby and let's talk about javascript. You've probably heard of them before, but still aren't fully understanding of exactly how these two languages really work. Like all programming languages, there are grammatical syntaxes and symbolic rules one must live by. For me to tell you everything would likely take more time for Angelina Jolie finishing raising her kids.

			So, what I can do is tell you about some differences they have; specifically, looping. First off, what is looping? Looping is iterating over a block of code as many times as needed. For instance, people with OCD will tend to ritualize their daily life, usually doing something a specific amount of times, much like what looping is in ruby and javascript. Now, how are they different?

			Ruby has many ways to loop. The easiest way to do so is to put a number and .times, like 10.times do... etc etc. which will run the block of code ten times. Ruby also has .each, method, which iterates over each item on a list.
			Javascript, on the other hand has the handy "for" which gives you some customation with how you want to loop. For contains 3 sets of rules after each other. For starters, you initiate it with creating variable and giving it a value, usually a number. You state the condition required to stop to loop, and what to change to the initial variable. Both javascript and ruby have a while method which means to keep looping while a certain condition is true.
