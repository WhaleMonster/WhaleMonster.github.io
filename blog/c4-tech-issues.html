			Today I would like to discuss a fairly big topic regarding technology and the state of it at least in the United States of America. Time Warner Cable and Comcast have unofficially monopolized ISPs throughout the nation and are charing a hefty price for internet some countries get for a lot less. But, then again, everything in America seems to be more expensive.

			Health care and college tuition between the US and most developed and sovereign nations have had a huge margin. The next emerging gap seems to be Internet Service Providers. We are told of speeds of up to 50mbps can be obtained for a good 80-100 dollars a month. However, it seems we don't really get that. Couple that up with throttling data for high traffic users, you are buying goods from the people that force you to buy goods.

			There is talk of Net Neutrality among many in the tech world. The belief is that ISPs should treat all data on the internet equally and not discriminating by user, site, or platform. The FCC had once been against it and now seem to try to be in favor of it. However, like all self-interested behavior, the idea is and always will be to get more money. Siding with the users will likely win them some favors. Sadly, I am not falling for it. Words can be words, but I would like to see physical evidense from the FCC of intent for user beneficiality.
