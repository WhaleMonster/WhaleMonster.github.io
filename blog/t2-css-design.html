			<span style="font-size: 25px">Margin, Border, and Padding<br>
			09.28.14</span>

			<p>In CSS, these three things are pretty crucial to knowing how to layout your site. Unless you plan on have object touching each other, it would be wise to know the difference between these three.</p>

			<p>Essentially, they are just layers with one going over the other like a hierchy of importance. Padding gets the most, so it will always be on top. Border would second and lastly margin. A good example is shown here:</p>

			<br><img id="pic"; src="../imgs/MarBorPad.png"><br>

			<p>In laymen's terms:
				<ul>
					<li>Orange is padding</li>
					<li>Blue is border</li>
					<li>Green is margin</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			Easy peasy lemon squeezy.</p>
